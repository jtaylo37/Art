I am not the biggest artist and I have not been doing art for that  long. My focus is on the technical side of development for things such as  virtual/augmented reality experiences or for game development. Though I enjoy  the technical side more, having experience in the creative side and being able to  think creatively will be a great asset to my future creations. This website is  a collection of artworks I made so far during my time at the university, I hope  to still work on my creative side to allow me to be well rounded for all aspects  of my desired field.</p></td>
